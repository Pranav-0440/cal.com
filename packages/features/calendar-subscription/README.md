# Calendar Subscription  

The **Calendar Subscription** feature keeps your calendars synchronized while ensuring efficient caching.  

When enabled, it uses **webhooks** to automatically listen for updates and apply changes in real time.  
This means new events, modifications, or deletions are instantly captured and reflected across the system â€” no manual refresh or constant polling required.  

## Key Benefits  
- **Efficiency**: reduces API calls with optimized caching strategies.  
- **Reliability**: guarantees updates through webhook event delivery.  
- **Real-Time Sync**: ensures calendars are always up-to-date with minimal latency.  
- **Scalability**: supports multiple calendars and handles high-volume updates seamlessly.  

By subscribing to calendars via webhooks, you gain a smarter, faster, and more resource-friendly way to keep your data in sync.
